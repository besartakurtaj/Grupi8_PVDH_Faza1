# Social Media vs Productivity - ETL Data Preprocessing Pipeline

This project implements a **modular ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline for analyzing how **social media usage** affects **productivity and stress levels**.
It is designed for **academic coursework and real-world data engineering**, applying professional preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering techniques.

---
## Phase 1 – Data Extraction, Validation, and Core Preparation

Phase 1 focuses on loading raw data, enforcing data consistency, performing initial validation, and preparing a clean, well-typed dataset ready for further preprocessing and feature engineering.

### Objectives

* Load raw CSV data
* Enforce consistent data types
* Detect and remove duplicates
* Assess data quality and logical inconsistencies
* Perform controlled sampling
* Prepare the dataset for downstream transformations

### Files and Responsibilities
#### extract.py

* Main entry point for Phase 1.
* Reads the raw CSV file
* Applies data type definitions
* Assesses data quality and logical constraints
* Reports missing values, duplicates, and descriptive statistics
* Removes duplicate rows
* Performs stratified sampling (default: 50%)
* Returns a cleaned pandas DataFrame

This script orchestrates most Phase 1 components and produces the dataset used in later phases.

#### data_type_definition.py

* Data type enforcement layer.
* Defines a centralized TYPE_MAPPING for all expected columns
* Converts columns to appropriate pandas dtypes (Int64, float64, category)
*

* Logs warnings when conversions fail
* Prints final column data types for verification

<img width="582" height="537" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b96444a-b36b-4b75-87ff-c106c7dea57c" />

* Ensures schema consistency across the pipeline.

#### duplicates.py

* Duplicate handling utility.
* Removes duplicate rows from the dataset

<img width="722" height="93" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a99a7f32-fa81-444a-a0fe-cb5269085ea7" />

* Supports optional column subsets and retention strategy
* Reports how many rows were removed
* Used during extraction to ensure data uniqueness.

#### data_quality.py

* Logical data validation module.
* Performs rule-based checks (e.g. age range, work hours, stress score bounds)
* Detects logically invalid or extreme values
* Produces a structured report of detected issues
* This step does not remove data but provides transparency and diagnostics.

#### data_sampling.py

* Sampling strategy implementation.
Supports:

* Simple random sampling
* Stratified sampling (by job_type when available)
* Configurable sampling fraction and random seed
* Used in Phase 1 to reduce dataset size while preserving representativeness.

#### column_names.py

* Column formatting utility.
* Converts snake_case column names into Title Case with spaces
* Can be run as a standalone script for CSV transformation
* Optional helper for presentation and reporting purposes.
  
#### main.py

* End-to-end pipeline entry point.
* Defines input and output file paths
* Executes the full ETL flow:

** extract_data() – raw data ingestion and validation
** transform_data() – cleaning, feature engineering, and reduction
** load_data() – saving the final dataset

This script is the recommended way to run Phase 1 from start to finish.

#### features.py

* Feature engineering module.
* Creates interaction and ratio-based features such as:
* Stress–sleep ratio
* Insomnia pressure

* Used by the enhanced feature reduction step
* Safeguards critical engineered features.

#### load.py

* Data loading and persistence layer.
