# Social Media vs Productivity – ETL Data Preprocessing Pipeline

This project implements a **modular ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline for analyzing how **social media usage** affects **productivity and stress levels**.  
It is designed for **academic coursework and real-world data engineering**, applying professional preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering techniques.

## Overview

### Objective
To transform raw behavioral data into a structured, enriched dataset that supports **machine learning**, **statistical analysis**, and **visual analytics**.

### Workflow Summary
1. Extract raw data and profile it.  
2. Validate and clean with logical quality checks.  
3. Impute missing values using dependency relationships.  
4. Encode and discretize categorical and numerical variables.  
5. Engineer new behavioral and psychological indicators.  
6. Reduce redundancy via correlation-based feature selection.  
7. Export a clean, ready-to-analyze dataset.

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages before running the project:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

---

## How to Run

1. Place your raw dataset (e.g., social_media_vs_productivity.csv) inside the data/ folder.  
   Example path:
   data/social_media_vs_productivity.csv

2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

3. Run the ETL pipeline using:
   python etl/main.py

4. The processed dataset will be saved automatically to:
   data/processed_dataset.csv
